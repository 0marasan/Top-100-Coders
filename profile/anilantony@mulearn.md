### About Me

> I am a dedicated Computer Science graduate from Mar Ivanios College in Trivandrum. My journey into the world of technology began around 2-2.5 years ago when I embraced the exciting realm of coding. With a strong foundation in Computer Science, I embarked on a 1.5-year journey as a Full Stack Developer at a real estate startup, where I specialized in the MERN stack. During this time, I had the privilege of leading multiple successful projects. My passion for technology is matched only by my enthusiasm for community building and knowledge sharing. I am eager to contribute my technical skills as an organizer in tech events, creating opportunities for meaningful networking and collaborative learning.
