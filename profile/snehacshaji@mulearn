### About Me

> I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology (BTech) degree in Computer Science and Engineering, a field that has always fascinated me with its dynamic nature and limitless possibilities. My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in programming, algorithms, and various aspects of computer science, which I am eager to apply in real-world scenarios.

To gain practical experience and broaden my horizons, I recently undertook an internship with Mulearn as part of their Operations team. This opportunity has allowed me to delve into the inner workings of a tech company, gaining insights into project management, quality assurance, and effective collaboration within a team. I've learned how to streamline processes, optimize resources, and ensure seamless operations, which I believe will be invaluable in my future career.

In addition to my academic pursuits and internship, I am an active member of the Community Development team at NEST 2023. This role has given me the chance to engage with my community and make a positive impact through various initiatives. Whether it's organizing events, conducting workshops, or fostering partnerships, I am committed to contributing to the betterment of society and using technology to address pressing issues.

Looking ahead, I am excited about the endless possibilities that the world of computer science and engineering offers. I aspire to leverage my academic knowledge, internship experience, and community involvement to make a meaningful difference in the tech industry and beyond. My goal is to continue learning, innovating, and collaborating with others to create a brighter future for all.

In summary, my journey through BTech in Computer Science and Engineering, my internship at Mulearn, and my role in the Community Development team at NEST 2023 reflect my dedication to personal growth, practical experience, and community engagement in pursuit of a fulfilling career in technology and social impact.
