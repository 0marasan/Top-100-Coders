### About Me


> I am a self-taught developer who loves to learn, connect, and grow. I'm currently pursuing my bachelor's in technology on computer science Engineering from the University College of Engineering, Kariavattom, Thiruvananthapuram. I am a freelancer who focuses on frontend web and Flutter application development. I help startups and small traditional businesses give life to their dreams. I am currently the Google Developers Students Club (GDSC) Lead of my campus and the CTO of Legacy IEDC-UCEK. My skillsets include `Javascript`, `React JS`, `Bootstrap/Tailwind CSS', `Dart`, 'Firebase', `Solidity` for development, and `Figma` for UI/UX designing. I had the opportunity to intern at `Syncrayons Technologies Pvt. Ltd.` as a frontend developer, where I got to explore and understand the tech industry.

- As a dream intiative, I aim to start a product-based startup to innovate and solve a real-life issue. My current journey is to achieve the required knowledge and experience to make that dream a reality.


#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:


- Kerala has the potential to excel in the technology startup ecosystem by nurturing local talent, fostering innovation, and creating a supportive environment for startups.
- But from my experience interning at a startup here in Kerala, what I noticed is that there are so many service-based startups that are emerging and at the same time shutting down around us.
- I believe that this is because of a change in the service provider culture. Once,Â  Indian companies used to receive a lot of service-based work, but it is now going downhill.
- So I believe that what Kerala's startup ecosystem needs are more product-based solution companies that address real-life issues. Gen Robotics is one of my inspirations in this domain.
- When we think of a tech-based startup, the normal thought is of a company that builds things for others, like websites, software, etc. But I believe we should focus on developing SAAS and other product-based solutions.
