#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- The initiatives of KSUM present huge opportunities for students to improve their creative thinking skills and put forward ideas for a better future.
- Before conducting hackathons or competitions, there needs to be proper awareness classes about these events in offline mode. Many students refrain from joining any events due to the lack of skills.
- They need to be encouraged to develop skills and need to be aware of the fact that skills can be developed from scratch.
