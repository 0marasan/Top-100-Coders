# Full Name 

### About Me

> A final year Computer Science student at Christ College of Engineering, I am passionate about creating engaging and user-friendly interfaces and graphics for various platforms and purposes. I have developed my skills in Figma, User Experience Design, User Interface Design, and Front-end Development through multiple projects, courses, and certifications.
Currently, I am working as a Design Apprentice at GTech MuLearn, a UI Designer at Tegain, and a Graphic Designer at Sanjos Voice, where I design content for press, magazines, and social media posts, as well as user interfaces for web and mobile applications. I have also been involved in video editing, poster making, and environmental photography, and have won several awards and recognitions for my work. I am always eager to learn new tools and techniques, and to collaborate with other developers and designers to deliver high-quality products and services.

#### As a Top 100 Member:

- As an aspiring software developer, being in the top 100 will help me become recognised among my peers for my abilites as a leader and a programmer.

- Furthermore, I will be able to encourage my peers to work beyond the college curriculum and become active in the coding and open source community.

#### Career Plan:

- I think the first step would be to address the knowledge gap. Show students that there are successful companies that began as a startup from college. This example, in addition to guidance and mentoring, will definitely ignite the entrepreneurship fire in our students and help them to strive to be their own boss.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala has a very strong population of curious and tech-savvy teenagers. This is a significant asset for the state. Projects like KBA, IEDC, KSUM, and many more serve as excellent platforms for those with similar interests to meet each other and build amazing things.
