#### Networking: 

- Having an active involvement in multiple communities like TinkerHub and GDSC, I've had the oppurtunity to connect with a wide array of individuals, each having their own perspectives and backgrounds. These interactions have been exceptionally productive for me, as someone passionate about technology.
- As a member of the Top 100 community, I would like to build connections through engaging discussions on technology and exchanging viewpoints. I'm particularly enthusiastic about addressing the prevalent skill gap among students. By collaborating with fellow members, we can collectively devise strategies to bridge this gap.

#### As a Top 100 Member: 

- On a personal level, this community serves as an invaluable showcase for my skills and expertise. It offers an opportunity to connect with like-minded individuals who share my passion for technology, potentially leading to collaborations in the future. This network promises to open new doors and avenues for me, providing significant benefits to my career .

It is not only about personal advancement; it is about contributing to the community. As a member, I look forward to offering my skills and expertise to assist my peers while developing myself.

#### Career Plan: 

- In the immediate term , I would like to increase the pool of students interested in tech through workshops , mentorships etc., and help people realise that learning tech is actually fun.
- In the long term,I want to introduce programs that let us learn by doing, through projects and real-world problem-solving. 
This approach would be great for both students, as well as startups as they often can't spend a lot of time on training. So, if we're already skilled up and ready to roll, we can dive right in and help bring innovative ideas to life.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem: 

- Kerala has a really good pool of people and communities interested in Tech. It has the potential to be a leader in Tech Innovation. Improving upon the existing human resource to help bring out unique, innovative and game changing ideas through a collaborative effort between industries , government and students( those looking for a career in tech ) will be key to developing the already existing ecosystem.
