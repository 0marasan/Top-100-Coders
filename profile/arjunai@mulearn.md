### About Me

Hey! I'm a third-year student at the College of Engineering Trivandrum, studying Computer Science and Engineering. I've always been super curious and love checking out new things. My life motto is 'Explore Evolve,' and it perfectly sums up my journey.
Tech stuff has always fascinated me, and playing around with different tech tools is like my favorite hobby. I'm really into hackathons and events because they let me dive deeper into the tech world and learn new things.

Outside of classes, I've been exploring different areas like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and web development. It's not just about getting good grades; I want to understand how to use technology to solve real-life problems.
I love how the tech industry is always changing and how each day is a chance to learn something new. I'm not just studying tech. I'm getting ready to be part of the cool stuff happening in the tech world.
