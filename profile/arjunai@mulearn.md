### About Me

Hey! I'm a third-year student at the College of Engineering Trivandrum, studying Computer Science and Engineering. I've always been super curious and love checking out new things. My life motto is 'Explore Evolve,' and it perfectly sums up my journey.
Tech stuff has always fascinated me, and playing around with different tech tools is like my favorite hobby. I'm really into hackathons and events because they let me dive deeper into the tech world and learn new things.

Outside of classes, I've been exploring different areas like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and web development. It's not just about getting good grades; I want to understand how to use technology to solve real-life problems.
I love how the tech industry is always changing and how each day is a chance to learn something new. I'm not just studying tech. I'm getting ready to be part of the cool stuff happening in the tech world.

### Portfolio Highlights
Had recently developed a product called 'Braille Vision' which is a tool having refreshable Braille. It enables blind and deaf people to understand their surroundings using computer vision and speech recognition.



#### Leadership and Influence: 

Currently Project lead at RoboCET, had organised numerous project expo's. Recently organised hardware robotics expo at Keraleeyam.
Had been AI/ML Lead at GDSC CET and had organised several workshop for community engagement.

#### Networking: 

 I plan to expand my network by attending industry conferences, workshops, participating in online forums and hackathons. I see networking not just as a means of personal growth but as an opportunity to contribute to a collaborative community where knowledge and experiences are shared for mutual benefit.
Engagement with top 100 coders would facilitate networking with the best coders in Kerala, fostering mutual learning and collaboration. This would prove as a great asset for my personal growth and curiosity.

To contribute to the community, I'd share my experiences, insights, and possibly create tutorials or blog posts on coding challenges and solutions. By actively participating in discussions, I aim to establish myself as a reliable and knowledgeable member, contributing to the collective growth of the Top 100 community.


#### As a Top 100 Member: 

I am enthusiastic about joining the Top 100 community because it represents an unparalleled opportunity to connect with Kerala's most skilled coders. As a professional in the tech industry, this community aligns seamlessly with my commitment to continuous learning and collaboration.
Being part of the Top 100 will directly benefit my career in several ways. Firstly, it offers a platform to stay abreast of cutting-edge trends and innovations in coding. This knowledge is invaluable in a dynamic field like technology, where staying ahead is crucial.
Secondly, the networking potential within the Top 100 is immense. Interacting with and learning from the best in Kerala's coding scene provides a unique chance to broaden my professional connections. This network not only facilitates knowledge exchange but also opens doors to potential collaborations and job opportunities.

#### Career Plan: 

In the immediate term, my focus is on active involvement within the Kerala Startup Ecosystem. I plan to engage with existing startups, attend local startup events, and network with entrepreneurs to understand the current challenges and opportunities. By participating in forums and discussions, I aim to contribute insights and ideas that can foster collaboration and innovation within the ecosystem.
Longer-term, my goal is to actively contribute to the growth of startups in Kerala. This involves potentially launching my venture, providing mentorship to budding entrepreneurs, and fostering a culture of innovation. Collaborating with educational institutions to bridge the gap between academia and industry is also part of my vision to create a robust pipeline of talent for startups.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem: `required field`

Kerala holds immense potential to excel in the technology startup ecosystem, and several strategic steps can be taken to foster this growth:

Investment and Funding: Encourage increased investment in startups by creating a robust venture capital ecosystem. Establishing a dedicated fund for technology startups, offering grants, and incentivizing private investors can provide the financial support necessary for growth.

Incubation and Acceleration: Strengthen incubation and acceleration programs to nurture early-stage startups. Providing mentorship, workspace, and access to resources can accelerate the development of innovative ideas, turning them into successful businesses.

Collaboration with Educational Institutions: Foster collaboration between startups and educational institutions. Establishing research and development partnerships can leverage the intellectual capital present in Kerala's educational institutions and create a talent pool that is aligned with industry needs.
