### About Me

  - I'm a third year student at Muthoot Institue of Technology and Science with a passion for Full Stack Development, primarily focusing on web development. I have a solid foundation in various web technologies including but not limited to: Tailwind, React, Vue, Nextjs, Nuxtjs, Nodejs, Express, MongoDB, and many more. Languages I'm proficient in include Javascript, C, Java, Python. I have sharpened my skills in problem-solving and algorithm design through the various projects I have done over the past few years. I'm currently working as a Junior Web Developer at a company Vexvo, working on developing websites for their various clients. I have made plenty of websites for my college in my free time inorder to keep my skills sharp and through this have managed to become the web developemnt lead at most of the clubs in my college. I'm also quite interested in cloud computing and have spent time familiarising myself with various cloud providers like AWS and GCP. My ultimate goal is to become a full fledged full stack developer capable of completing the entire process of building an app from start to finish. I plan to expand my skillset towards android development and desktop development in the future and have started learning Jetpack Compose as the first step.
